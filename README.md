## Overview of the analysis: 
While on vacation in Hawaii last year I discovered a newfound passion for surfing. I've been trying to come up with a plan that will let me not just return to Hawaii but live there forever. I finally come up with an idea that I think is foolproof. A surf n'Shake shop serving surfboards  and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course myself.Also, I have some savings I am willing to invest, but I will need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. So after putting together a strong business plan I reach out to an investor W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing. Our first meeting with him goes extremely well but he has one concern. What about the weather? He is extremely serious about this. He invested in a surf shop early in his career.However, he did not ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence. W, Avy knows I have been learning how to properly analyze data and he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results: 
## June Temperatures

#### The mean in June Temperature is around 75F
#### The min and max Temperatures are 64F and 85F
#### The standard deviation is 3.26


## December Temperatures

#### The mean in December is around 71F
#### The min and max Temperatures are 56F and 83F
#### The standard deviation is 3.75
## Summary: 
We can conclude that the months of December and June are very similar in Temperatures.
Also, We know W, Avy invested in a surf shop early in his career.However, he did not ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence. Because of that, extras queries will be precipitation, wind, rainy and stormy to gather more weather data.
